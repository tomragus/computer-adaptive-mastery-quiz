def generate_prompt(text_chunk):
    """Generate the detailed pedagogical prompt for Gemini to create quiz questions."""
    return f"""
You are a teacher who is designing a test with multiple choice questions (each with 4 answer choices) to test content from a passage.
Given the following passage or notes, generate exactly 20 multiple choice questions that test comprehension and critical thinking. The questions must vary in difficulty. If there is not enough content to write 20 good questions, repeat or expand the material, or create additional plausible questions that still test content that is similar to what is in the passage.
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - NO TEXT REFERENCES:**
- Questions must be COMPLETELY SELF-CONTAINED and not reference the original text
- DO NOT use phrases like "according to the passage," "the text states," "the first example," "as mentioned," "the author discusses," etc.
- DO NOT reference specific figures, tables, pages, or sections from the passage
- Present all necessary context within the question itself
- Students should be able to answer based on their understanding of the concepts, not memory of where things appeared in the text
- Frame questions as direct concept tests, not reading comprehension
- If there is information about ISBN or ebook distribution consequences or copyrights, do not ask questions about these things. Only ask questions about academic content
**CRITICAL: Design Questions That Test TRUE MASTERY, Not Test-Taking Skills**
Your goal is to create questions where students CANNOT get the correct answer through:
- Process of elimination with obviously implausible answers
- Common sense reasoning without domain-specific knowledge
- Guessing based on option patterns, lengths, or complexity differences
- Recognizing what "sounds right" based on everyday language
- Using the question wording itself as a hint to the answer
- For questions above the remember difficulty band, questions that a student who memorizes information in the reading without true understanding can answer correctly
Generate exactly 20 questions that vary across difficulty levels. Questions should test **conceptual understanding and application**, not just recall of text. Use the uploaded material to determine:
1. What concepts are explicitly stated and factual: these support easy or "Remember" questions.
2. What concepts require connecting multiple ideas or interpreting examples: these support medium or **Understand** or **Apply** questions.
3. What concepts require analysis of interactions, synthesis, or predicting outcomes based on material in the text → these support medium/hard and hard or **Analyze**, **Evaluate**, or **Create** questions.
Use the passage to determine which concepts can be recalled, applied, analyzed, or synthesized. Do not assign difficulty randomly.
**For EVERY question, ensure:**
1. **All four options are plausible to someone WITHOUT domain expertise**
   - Wrong answers should represent actual misconceptions or partial understanding
   - Avoid absurd options that anyone could eliminate (e.g., if asking about a biological process, don't include "it turns purple" as an option)
   - All options should be similar in length, specificity, and technical complexity
   - Don't mix highly technical language in one option with casual language in others
2. **The question cannot be answered through linguistic/semantic clues alone**
   - Don't ask "What does [term] do?" when the term's name in everyday English reveals the answer
   - Avoid questions where the correct answer repeats key words from the question
   - Don't make the correct answer significantly more detailed/specific than wrong answers
   - Ensure wrong answers use equally precise terminology
3. **Wrong answers reflect genuine confusion, not nonsense**
   - Each wrong answer should be what a student might choose if they:
     * Confused two related concepts
     * Applied a rule from a different context
     * Made a common calculation error
     * Remembered only part of the concept
   - Never include options that are absurd or completely unrelated to the topic
**Difficulty Calibration Guidelines:**
When estimating "estimated_correct_pct", consider that students may have:
- General intelligence and test-taking skills
- Ability to eliminate absurd options
- Common sense reasoning
- Pattern recognition abilities
**Your difficulty estimates should reflect:**
85–100% correct (Very Easy / Direct Recall)
Students can answer by recalling a fact, definition, or formula explicitly stated in the passage.
Requires no calculation, inference, or application beyond what is written.
All four options must be plausible and technically correct; distractors should reflect common small misconceptions.
70–84% correct (Easy / Understanding / Single-Step Reasoning)
Requires one step of reasoning or minor inference beyond direct recall.
Students must connect a concept in the passage to a similar context or slightly different phrasing, but it is still straightforward.
Wrong answers should reflect adjacent or related concepts that a partial understanding might confuse.
50–69% correct (Medium / Application / Multi-Step Reasoning)
Requires applying principles from the passage to a new scenario or combining multiple pieces of information.
The passage does not explicitly solve this problem, so students must adapt knowledge.
Distractors should be plausible errors that someone might make if they misapplied formulas, misremembered conditions, or partially understood the concept.
30–49% correct (Hard / Analysis / Synthesis)
Requires deep understanding, integration, or analysis of multiple concepts in the passage.
Students must infer relationships, compare methods, or predict outcomes not directly explained.
Wrong answers should seem correct to someone with partial understanding, exploiting subtle distinctions or counterintuitive results.
Below 30% correct (Very Hard / Evaluation or Creation)
Requires expert-level judgment, design, or synthesis, combining multiple principles in novel ways.
Multiple answers might seem defensible; students must evaluate, critique, or generate solutions based on passage principles.
Distractors reflect plausible alternative interpretations, partial understanding, or common advanced mistakes.
**Requirements**:
- 5 easy (≥85%), 5 medium (60–84%), 5 medium-hard (40-60%), 5 hard (<40%)
**Each question must include the following fields:**
- "question": A clear, concise, and unambiguous question that tests understanding of concepts from the passage. The question should be COMPLETELY SELF-CONTAINED with all necessary context included. Never reference "the passage," "the text," specific examples by position (first, second, etc.), or figures/tables. Ask about the concept directly.
- "options": An array of exactly 4 strings in this exact format:
    [
      "A. [First option text]",
      "B. [Second option text]",
      "C. [Third option text]",
      "D. [Fourth option text]"
    ]
  Each string must start with the letter and period. Do not use an object/dictionary structure. It is 4 plausible answer choices labeled "A", "B", "C", and "D" (with one being correct). ALL four options must be similar in:
    * Length (within 20% of each other)
    * Specificity and detail level
    * Technical complexity
    * Grammatical structure
  Wrong answers must represent genuine misconceptions from the domain, not random nonsense.
- "correct_answer": The letter ("A", "B", "C", or "D") corresponding to the correct option.
- "explanation": A deep, pedagogically useful explanation that teaches the concept behind the correct answer. The explanation must:
    1. Start by stating the correct letter and full answer
    2. Explain WHY that answer is correct using conceptual reasoning - explain mechanisms, properties, or principles
    3. For each incorrect answer, explain:
       - Why it's wrong
       - What specific misconception or error would lead someone to choose it
       - What partial understanding might make it seem correct
    4. Focus on teaching the underlying concept, not referencing where information appeared in the text
    5. Use the tone of a tutor helping a student understand the concept
- "cognitive_level": Choose from "Remember", "Understand", "Apply", "Analyze", "Evaluate", or "Create" based on the cognitive skill actually tested.
- "estimated_correct_pct": Numeric estimate of percentage of students expected to answer correctly (0-100).
  **CRITICAL**: If your estimate is below 70%, you MUST verify:
  - All four options are genuinely plausible to a non-expert
  - No options can be eliminated through pure logic/common sense
  - The question cannot be answered by someone clever who lacks domain knowledge
  - Wrong answers represent actual conceptual confusions, not absurdities
  If you cannot verify all of these, INCREASE the percentage estimate.
- "reasoning": Brief rationale for the percentage assignment. **If estimated_correct_pct < 70%**, you MUST explain:
  1. What specific domain knowledge is required that common sense/logic cannot provide
  2. Why each wrong answer would seem plausible to someone with partial understanding
  3. What makes this question resistant to test-taking strategies
  If you cannot provide specific explanations for all three points, your difficulty estimate is too low.
All math expressions must use valid LaTeX format with $...$ for inline math and $$...$$ for display math.
Before finalizing each question, verify that the correct answer and every explanation are explicitly supported by factual information or definitions present in the passage. Please make sure that every correct answer is clearly correct and every incorrect answer is clearly incorrect.
Focus on testing conceptual understanding rather than text memorization.
If the passage contains code, mathematical derivations, or data tables, generate questions about:
- How the logic/process works (not "what does line 5 do")
- What results mean and why (not "what is the output")
- When to apply methods (not "what is this method called")
- Why approaches differ (not "which method is shown")
Return **only** a valid JSON array of 20 questions. Focus on testing conceptual understanding rather than text memorization.
Do not include any text, commentary, or markdown fences.
Output must begin with `[` and end with `]` — no explanations outside JSON.
